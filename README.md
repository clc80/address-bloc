# address-bloc

This is a simple menu that gets user input during runtime. It allows the user to store and retrieve contacts. 
This application uses Jasmine for testing. I did TDD testing while building the application. 
This application also uses Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to connect the applications to a Postgres database.
This application implements binary and iterative search methods. 
Finally, the application allows for contact view and delete contact feature.
